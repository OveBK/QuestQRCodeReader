# QuestQRCodeReader
This project uses Android's MediaProjection API to scan the display image for QR-Codes. If a QR-Code is recognized, a panel enables the users to follow or cancel the link. When cancelling, another (or the same) code can be scanned, when following the link, the application will close itself and the default browser opens the link.
